“No, no!”, Feynman objected strongly.

“They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.”

I would say: Writing is a test. It tests if you understand the subject well enough, and the "other person" well enough, to communicate it to that other person. 
Most likely you don't so then you need to think and/or learn more so that you can redraft it so it works. Write something technical and it reveals how little you know!

It is a trope but it works: Write your problem to the most senior developer in an email/slack but don't press send. 
Then there is a probably 50% chance you will solve it, or reduce the scope of the problem to {more focuesed question} that you can ask about.
